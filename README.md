# 👋 Hello, I'm Coline!

A new passionate full stack developer from Paris currently in web and mobile web development bootcamp training. 
Here's a little about me:

## 🌱 What I'm Currently Learning
I am currently finalizing my portfolio in React JS. Available soon...

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** JavaScript
- **Front-end:** React, HTML5, CSS3
- **Back-end:** Node.js
- **Databases:** MySQL
- **Others:** Git, GitHub, Agile/Scrum, Figma, Photoshop

## 🚀 Projects

### [Wildgram](https://coline1186.github.io/Wildgram/)
Creation, as a team, of our very first web page with a professional design using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS after 2 weeks of training. It claimed to be our school's new social network 😉.

### The Hero Experience
In REACT, build a dynamic web app that uses data from an API while adhering to the Agile methodology.
In a world where superheroes exist but there are no more supervillains, we had the idea to create a platform where these heroes could offer their services for all kinds of events and services. 

### Gems
First full stack project, this project is a premium marketplace website designed for private individuals to buy and sell luxury products. Built using React (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and Express. In progress.
